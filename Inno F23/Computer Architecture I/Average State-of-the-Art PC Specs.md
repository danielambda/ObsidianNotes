- Processor clock speed: 2-3.5 GHz (up to 10.0 GHz, see note) 
- 100X performance in last decade. 
- Memory capacity: 10,000 MB (10.0 GB) 
- Disk capacity: 20,000 GB (20.0 TB) 
- New units! Mega =>Giga, Giga =>Tera =>Peta =>Exa =>Zeta =>Yotta
## NOTE:
- 10GHz clock speed is not practical due to heat dissipation problems. On modern computers the clock rate achieved over 4Ghz and later was scaled back due to aforementioned problems. The current direction of improving performance is different from increasing clock rate: adding more parallelism to microarchitecture, adding hardware support for multithreading, using multi-core clusters, and specialized hardware, optimized for certain tasks (like GPU for 3D graphics)
