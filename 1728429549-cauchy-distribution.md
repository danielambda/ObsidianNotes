## Definition
- A [[Random Variable]] $\xi$ is said to have the Cauchy distribution if it has [[1728426412-probability-density-function|Probability Density Function]]:
$$
   p_\xi (x) = \frac{1}{\pi(x^2+1)}
$$

## Properties
- No [[1728426627-moments-of-a-continuos-random-variable|moments]], and, therefore, no [[Expected Value]]

## Appearance
Circular light source emits particles in a random direction following the uniform distribution (in the angle Î¸). These particles hit the ground randomly, with the hitting coordinate being a random variable with the Cauchy distribution
