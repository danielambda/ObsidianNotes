## Definition
- A [[Binary Search Tree]] (BST) is a [[Binary Tree]] that allows efficient search.
- The keys in a BST satisfy a binary search tree property
## Binary search tree property
- For any node $x$ in a BST
    1. If $y$ is a node in the left subtree of $x$, then $y.key\leq x.key$
    2. if $y$ is a node in the right subtree of $x$, then $y.key\geq x.key$
## Supported Operations
```
search(key)
add(item)
remove(item) or remove(key)
removeMax()
removeMin()
findMax()
findMin()
```
## Recursive Search
```cs
Node TreeSearch(Node x, int k)
{
    if (x is null || k == x.Key)
        return x;

    if (k < x.key)
        return TreeSearch(x.Left, k);

    return TreeSearch(x.Right, k);
}
```
## Iterative Search
```cs
Node IterativeTreeSearch(Node x, int k)
{
    while (x is not null && k != x.Key)
    {
        if (k < x.key)
            x = x.Left;
        else
            x = x.Right;
    }

    return x;
}
```
## Insertion
- To insert into a [[Binary Search Tree]]:
    1. Search for the place for the key in a [[Binary Tree]]
    2. Insert element as a leaf at the node where the search ended
## Deletion
- To delete from a [[Binary Search Tree]]:
    1. Search for the node to remove
    2. If the node is not found - return
    3. If the node is a leaf -- remove it
    4. If the node has one child
        - Remove the node
        - Attach the subtree instead of the deleted node to its parent
    5. If the node has two children:
        - Exchange the node with a successor (or a predecessor) node
        - Recursively remove the node from its new place
